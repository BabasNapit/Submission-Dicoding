                      Facilities and infrastructure performance optimization
                      using Python and GUI involves developing interactive and
                      efficient software solutions. Through a graphical user
                      interface (GUI), users can easily access and utilize the
                      features provided to optimize the use of facilities and
                      infrastructure. Python is used for sophisticated data
                      processing and modeling, enabling in-depth analysis of
                      system performance. With the integration between Python
                      and the GUI, users can perform intuitive monitoring,
                      modeling, and decision-making, thus ensuring optimal
                      performance of facilities and infrastructure in accordance
                      with the set needs and objectives.

                      Analyzing the accuracy and efficiency of an automatic fire
                      extinguishing system using ATMega8535 and a flame sensor
                      involves an in-depth evaluation of the system's response
                      in detecting and tackling fires. Through the use of
                      sensitive flame sensors, the system is able to quickly
                      identify fires and provide a timely response. The
                      evaluation focused on sensor reliability, system response
                      time, and extinguishing capability. In addition, the
                      efficient use of resources such as electrical power was
                      also considered. This analysis helped to refine and
                      improve the performance of the system to provide better
                      protection against fire, in accordance with the needs and
                      applicable safety standards.

                      Doorlock System use RFID
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                      This is an Arduino-controlled electronic door lock system
                      that uses an RFID reader for authentication. It consists
                      of a solenoid door lock, 12V power supply, LEDs, RFID
                      module, and the Arduino board as the controller. The
                      operation involves presenting a valid RFID tag to the
                      reader, which signals the Arduino to activate the solenoid
                      lock and green LED to unlock the door. After a set delay
                      or tag removal, the Arduino de-energizes the solenoid,
                      locking the door again and potentially illuminating the
                      red LED. The Arduino's programming manages RFID
                      authentication, lock control, and LED status based on the
                      RFID reader input, enabling keyless entry via RFID cards
                      or fobs instead of traditional keys.
